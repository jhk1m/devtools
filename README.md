![image](assets/banner.png)

### inspiration

`devutils` is mac only and `devtoys` is windows only.
so heres devtools-x a x-platform collection of dev-tools, lighter, probably safer, and feature rich devepment utilities.

> Note: Application is under development, expect some bugs.

## Installation

Download the correct package from github releases section. and start using it :D. more ways to installing are coming soon.

## Features

Entire project is a webapp (not electron, read below). it uses `monaco editor` as text editor everywhere. so if you use vs-code then all the keyboard shortcuts like
`Ctrl-F` or `Ctrl-X` will work just fine. or even opening vscode command menu to perform complicated operations like format or set language etc
rest of the features are pretty straightforward.

DevTools-X comes with following features (with demo video):

## Tech Stack

It's very important for everyone to understand this section. People have choices, just like me. Some of you may not use a tool
just because it's electron. and the hate is justifiable. I personally don't want to run a chrome + nodejs for every app I launch

Which is why devtool-x is **NOT WRITTEN IN ELECTRON**

Devtools-X uses native webview to achieve the desktop application, called as [Tauri](https://tauri.studio/). native webview gives me
development speed of electron (react+ts) while being secure and low on ram, and staying cross platform at the same time.

UI uses React + TS + [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/)
Backend is Rust

## FAQ

#### Whats up with the bad looking UI

It was even worse before. I am not a UI developer, I understand react but not colors.
feel free to contribute

#### Do I need to know rust to get started?

Absolutely not. I don't know rust myself and I have a complete application created from scratch.

## NEED HELP IN:

- More features
- Testing
- Can logo be improved?
- Regex Tester is kinda broken, monaco gives headache
- Fix ALL FIXME: s and TODO: s
- a db integration for storing configuration? optional
- Security. Check CSP and fix the worker loading
- Stress testing especially hashers and image compressor
